# Keyboard_Cases
A Repo of Case Designs
Originally was hoped to have some sense of organization, which may be seen below
Each zip file will have at the very least the main body of the case in both a version for tapered heat sets and straight heat sets (M2).
If I had to make a plate I'll try to remember the dxf, and I'll also try to remember to include the bottom base plate as an stl and a dxf.
That way it's easy to Send Cut Send.

The aspirational and obsolete structure (for now)

Top level is "Keyboard Cases"

Second level is "Manufacturer/Inspiration"

Third level is "Case_Name"

Fourth level contains Case, any Base plate and or spacers required, as well as a "Plates" folder

Plates will hold the plate files that work with the case, accomodating multiple layouts of the board

They are made with 3DP in mind M2 heat sets (3.1mm hole for heatsets)
