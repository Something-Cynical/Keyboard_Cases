A Repo of Case Designs

Each zip file will have at the very least the main body of the case in both a version for tapered heat sets and straight heat sets (M2) I hope...
If I had to make a plate I'll try to remember the dxf (otherwise it's kinda useless), and I'll also try to remember to include the bottom base plate as an stl and a dxf.
That way it's easier to use.

I would definitely double check all of the holes for your preferred heat sets.

The use of a magnetic connecter or small pigtail is suggested to bring the USB access to acceptable levels.

They are made with heat sets in mind at the moment just so it can be accessible to anyone with a 3D printer and access to McMaster M2 heat set inserts
