# Keyboard_Cases
A Repo of Case Designs
Originally was hoped to have some sense of organization, which may be seen below.
Each zip file will have at the very least the main body of the case in both a version for tapered heat sets and straight heat sets (M2).
If I had to make a plate I'll try to remember the dxf (otherwise it's kinda useless), and I'll also try to remember to include the bottom base plate as an stl and a dxf.
That way it's easy to Send Cut Send.

I would definitely double check all of the holes for your preferred heat sets

The aspirational structure (for now)

Top level is "Keyboard Cases"

Second level is "Manufacturer/Inspiration" (except for the zip file in there that's currently just the kbb cassette lookalike)

Third level is "Case"

Fourth level contains "Board Support" (to some extent it may also have zip files named with the board name)

Fifth level contains zip file with the stls and depending on things any number of the files described above.

They are made with heat sets in mind at the moment just so it can be accessible to anyone with a 3D printer and access to McMaster M2 inserts
